# Bovine-microbiota-colonization-history
This repository contains codes, data, and supplementary files for our manuscript on the bovine rumen microbiota colonization history. Here, we investigate the colonization history of large beef cattle population looking at early rumen microbiota colonization dynamics and persistence of early rumen microbiome colonizers across age, sex, and diet.
